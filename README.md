## Developing an Online News Aggregator

#### Human and Non-Human Actors of Selective Exposure


<p style="text-align: right;">Andrea Daniele Galeffi</p>

## Aims

Design, implement and test a **customizable** online news aggregator

A *lab* for studying the effects of *user-side customization* of the news feed

Give some agency back to final users

---

## Theory to practice

The main design choices are grounded in an *extensive* literature review on

- news aggregation, and the mechanisms behind it
- the risks connected with the emergence of **selective exposure** or even **self-polarisation**

---

### Selective Exposure

it emerges during Web navigation
 - the easy **acceptance of attitude-abiding information,**
 - the **exclusion of counter-attitudinal information**

## Echo Chambers

highly personalized communication environments 
built around the ability of users to follow 
like-minded individuals (Lazer et al., 2017)
```

### Filter Bubbles

[...] intermediate structures, formed in online 
digital space, which limit userâ€™s exposure to 
the full spectrum of news and information available 
on the internet (Han et al., 2022)
```


---

## echo chambers vs. filter bubbles

can we separate phenomena which are **fostered by the design of social media** from those which **stem from characteristics of human nature?**

---

## The Software

<img src='https://github.com/ADGaleffi/FlaskNews/blob/main/GraficoFlaskNews.png?raw=true'>

1. retrieves articles in JSON form from NEWSAPI

2. filters/prepares the newsfeed by applying user preferences

---

## Customizing API requests

```python  
NEWS_API_URL = f'https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=us&apiKey={NEWS_API_KEY}'
```

---

## Post-fetch filters


```python
filtered_news_data = [article for article in news_data if article.get('source', {}).get('id') != excluded_source]

return render_template('index.html', news_data=filtered_news_data, sources=sources)
```

---

## The dashboard

De-serialise and graphically render the newsfeed

---

## The Input

```html
<div class="news-container">
    {% for index in range(0, news_data|length, 3) %}
        <div class="row">
            {% for offset in range(3) %}
                {% set article_index = index + offset %}
                {% if article_index < news_data|length %}
                    {% set article = news_data[article_index] %}
                    <div class="news-item">
                    [...]
```

## The Output: interim user interface

## Opening the sidebar

---

## Use cases

- read-it-all about Football but leave Juventus FC out

- each February, avoid the misery of Italy crashing out the 6 Nations

- preserve mental health by avoiding news about war/pandemics

---

## Summary

- a new tool for studying self-polarisation and selective exposure

- An effective, customisable newsfeed filter

- so far, only subtractive filters are implemented

- possible integration with the [Zeeschuimeer project](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/zeeschuimer)
